Welcome!

I'm Yacine Dahmani, a beginner programmer eager to learn and grow in the coding world. This repository is my playground where I experiment, build projects, and document my journey.

What you'll find here:

Projects that reflect my learning progress, from basic concepts to small-scale applications.
Code that may not be perfect yet, but it's constantly evolving as I learn and improve.
Openness to feedback and collaboration â€“ I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills!
Join me on my coding adventure!

Feel free to browse my projects and see how I'm tackling beginner challenges.
Fork my repositories, play around with the code, and contribute your own ideas (no pressure!).
If you have any tips or suggestions, I'd be incredibly grateful to learn from you.
Let's connect!

While I don't have a fancy portfolio yet, feel free to reach out to me on:

Thank you for visiting!

P.S.  Even beginners can create awesome things. Stay tuned to see what I build next!
